# Crypto-Ransomware-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-Models

This script detects ransomware families. Six classifiers are built with the Grid Search algorithm for hyperparameter tuning. 
The confusion matrix, AUROC, and the Precision-Recall curve of the best-performed classifier are plotted.
Required python lib: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn
Platform: Spyder (others may work too)
